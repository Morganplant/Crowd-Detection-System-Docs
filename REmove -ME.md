Hi Morgan,

I've had a chance to look over your draft report. Here's some feedback:

You will need to add a cover sheet with a title page, table of contents, and statement of originality to the report.

Pay attention to general grammar and punctuation throughout the report as I spotted a few areas with unusual capitalization to ensure clarity and correctness.

Make sure the objectives alignment with the project's outcomes and that each objective is clearly defined.

Finally I'd advise that you get others to read your report

Overall, your report is comprehensive and detailed. Adding these elements will make it more professional.

Best regards, Ian
