Every so often we scan the network at night to get a baseline of the networking devices, switches, router, Access points, etc, the networking infrastructure, this can then be ignored in subsequent scans to detect crowds.

During the quieter hours of the night, we would conduct periodic network scans to establish a foundational baseline of the networking devices present. These scans encompass a comprehensive range of network components, including switches, routers, and access points, etc. Providing a detailed overview of our networking infrastructure. These initial scans serve as a foundational reference point for subsequent scans aimed at crowd detection. By identifying and cataloging the devices present during these off-peak scans, I can effectively filter out known entities from our crowd detection algorithms, thereby augmenting the accuracy and reliability of our monitoring systems.
