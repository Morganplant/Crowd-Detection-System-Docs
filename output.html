<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project revolves around the concept, execution, and evaluation
of a crowd density and presence detection system. Utilizing Wi-Fi
technology the system aims to determine areas of high crowd density,
providing users with information for making informed decision making.
The name of this project is “Crowd Pulse”.</p>
<p>Users will interact with the system in a way designed to be usable by
anyone, this interface will be in the form of a web interface, allowing
users, to locate the high density areas, to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>The Crowd Pulse System was designed to facilitate 3 major use cases:
1. Show Students where the busy areas on a university campus are. 2.
Identify areas, with low resource allocation, for example a science lab
that has low average usage. 3. locate potential security risks, and
events such as protests, and gatherings. ### Project Description This
Project was designed to identify busy areas on a university campus, and
to allow people to make informed decisions, based on the crowd presence
in certain areas, and was specifically designed for the 3 major use
cases mentioned above</p>
<p>Crowd Pulse works using two methods: 1. <strong>Network
Topology</strong> - When given the Wi-Fi network Topology, Crowd Pulse
will identify the areas, that are the busiest. 2.
<strong>Scanning</strong> - Crowd Pulse can utilise network scanning
techniques, to identify, the crowd density of the network as a whole, as
well as identify network infrastructure devices, to avoid confusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!quote] Objective The Overall goal of this project is to create a
modern and efficient solution for monitoring crowd presence and density
in a university campus setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crowd Pulse offers the capability to monitor and analyse historical
crowd density data for different locations, allowing users, to identify
areas that are busy at certain times of day. This is done by utilising
the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, Other alternative discovery methods
where considered, the benefits and drawbacks of which are talked about
later in this report.</p>
<p>This Project was Guided by the Project Management Tools and workflows
below, which are talked about in more detail in the design and
management section of this report: 1. GitHub Project’s [1] 2. SMART
targets [2] 3. Weekly Project Log 4. Agile and Waterfall Methodologies
[3][4] 5. Project Phases and Task Management ### Motivations My
reasoning for creating the Crowd Pulse project was threefold 1. I wanted
to test my abilities and Problem Solving Skills in a meaningful and
challenging way. 2. I wanted to minimize the impact of a potential
Isolation incident after the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 3. I wanted
to locate busy areas around the campus, either to avoid those areas for
quiet study time, or to specifically seek them out to engage the people
there.</p>
<p>I wanted to develop a system that would also be a great advantage to
avoid queues in stores, cafes, and other areas. It would allow users to
locate busy areas and then be able to plan around that new data, There
is no such system that helps in this regard hence why I thought it might
provide an interesting and challenging problem to solve. ### Ethics
During the development of Crowd Pulse it was important to me that I not
cross any ethical boundaries, and made sure to keep this thought
throughout the entirety of the project, I wanted to be mindful of the
privacy and data security of those being monitored.</p>
<h4 id="privacy-data-security">Privacy &amp; Data Security</h4>
<p>Due to the nature of the project I knew that it may involve the
privacy of individuals and decided that I would only collect only the
bare minimum amount of data to enable crowd pulse’s functionality as I
knew it might raise privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Given the nature of a system that collects and analyses user data,
ensuring the security and integrity of the data is of utmost importance,
as such Crowd Pulse will endeavour to use the minimal amount of user
data possible to ensure there is no useful way for Crowd Pulse to be
used to track individuals.</p>
<p>During the Project I decided that I would not use live public data,
and would generate my own synthetic data, to avoid infringing on
people’s privacy and security.</p>
<h3 id="things-learned-during-the-project">Things learned during the
project</h3>
<p>During the Project I learnt more about networking, how to manage a
project, and efficiently manage my time. - I discovered that network
topology was unknowable as a “user device” - I discovered that an easier
way to implement this would be to change the specific network
architecture to divide areas into different subnets, for example, the
library building is on subnet 3 and the student union building is on
subnet 4. - I discovered that the process of MAC Address Swapping has
changed in recent years [5] - I realised that Scanning a network using a
large network range class, requires more time or should be parallelized
[6] ### Professional Considerations Throughout the development and
future deployment of a System such as Crowd Pulse, it is and was
essential to uphold professional standards, best practices and ensuring
the quality and reliability of the Crowd Pulse System. ### Project Scope
The scope of the Crowd Pulse project encompasses the design and
development of a crowd density, presence detection system within a
university campus settings.</p>
<p>Moreover, the project scope extends to considerations of scalability
and adaptability, ensuring that the system can be tailored to different
university areas and potentially extended to other public spaces. The
project will also delve into the integration of security and privacy
measures, ethical and legal compliance, and the potential for future
enhancements and expansions of the system. Clear delineation of the
project scope is fundamental to aligning expectations, resources, and
deliverables throughout the development and implementation phases. ##
Problem Description ### What is the Problem?</p>
<p>The Crowd Pulse Project aims to solve 3 problems; Crowd Monitoring,
Effective Resource Allocation and Security of Campus Safety.</p>
<p>This Project’s aim is to develop an efficient monitoring solution for
crowd density, across a university campus. This System is capable of
providing insight into, resource utilisation and Crowd Density. This is
done by using the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to show busy locations
in a campus environment. #### Project Focuses The <strong>Primary
Focus</strong> as Stated above is the Crowd Monitoring System. The Aim
is to get valuable insights into the typical movements of crowd
behaviour, using the crowd density variations throughout the day, this
understanding would empower the campus staff, security and students to
make informed proactive decisions such as: - Deciding what time to get
lunch, study etc. - When to Go to bars and cafes to either maximise or
minimize exposure to people - Redirect equipment to areas with more use
- Event coordination - Individual Time scheduling - Correlation with
lectures attendance Ultimately, the overarching objective is to gather
data about the crowd density on a university campus.</p>
<p>The <strong>Secondary Focuses</strong> are <em>Resource
allocation</em> and <em>improvements to Safety</em>, which can be
improved by first identifying areas that are busy and those that are
not, with this data Staff can then make better decisions on what to do
during events or where to allocate more resources. It could be used
during open days to show where the most popular areas for new students
is, or show the most popular university housing areas.</p>
<h4 id="safety-and-security---secondary-focus">Safety and Security -
Secondary Focus</h4>
<p>Enhancing safety and security is a core aspect of this project. Crowd
Pulse has the potential to significantly augment campus security
infrastructure. By providing information on crowd activity across
campus, the system empowers security personnel to quickly identify and
address potential security issues. Additionally, it allows proactive
monitoring of high-traffic areas, enabling pre-emptive safety measures.
With data visualization, security teams can strategically allocate
resources, optimize patrol routes. Overall, integrating this system not
only fortifies campus security but also cultivates a proactive safety
culture, prioritizing the well-being of students, faculty, and staff.
### How Does Crowd Pulse Solve this? As explained earlier Crowd Pulse
Aims to solve and improve the following: - Crowd Monitoring - Effective
Resource Allocation - Security of Campus Safety</p>
<p>Crowd Pulse Does this by utilising two methods: 1. Scanning method 2.
Topology method</p>
<p>In the scanning method, crowd pulse scans the Wi-Fi network to
identify the crowd density of the network which can then be down to the
user.</p>
<p>In the topology methodology, crowd pulse uses it’s knowledge of the
Wi-Fi network topology to identify the crowd density of different
locations, determined by the Wireless Access point. ### Has it been done
before Crowd Pulse is not the first in this project space, there are
many projects that revolve around crowd monitoring and the analysis of
that data. However these systems often use different methods to capture
the crowd presence data, such as: - Computer Vision - Weight Monitoring
(mostly used on trains) - IoT Sensors - Body Heat Detection</p>
<p>Using These methods can be inefficient as shown with the problems
below: - Computer vision requires that cameras be set up at all the
exits and entrances, as well as expensive software to identify people
and monitor when unique people enter and exit buildings. - Weight
monitoring requires that all people are of similar weights to identify
how many people are in an area, this is not always the case as children
do not weigh as much as adults, and the weight variability between
adults is large, and so there is not an accurate way of measuring crowd
density, this method also requires having weight sensors setup
everywhere. - IoT sensors, depending on the implementation it can be a
good way of identifying people, but it requires lots of small devices to
be placed around an area for monitoring, which all require power and a
way to get that data out of the device. - Body Heat systems, can be
thrown off by large heat sources and so are not a good indication of
crowd density, it is also hard to generate crowd density values if there
is a large crowd if the crowd is packed tightly together, so heat
sources are not easy to distinguish. #### Why is Crowd Pulse Better?
Crowd Pulse utilises the existing network topology, supplemented with
scanning techniques, that allow the system more accuracy than the
techniques listed above, it uses the network topology available to
determine areas based on active device counts. However that being said
Crowd Pulse has it’s own faults, such as if the network goes down, then
there is no data to analyse. ### Why is this being solved? After the
COVID-19 pandemic there is a need to address the problem of crowd
detection, this project is an important step towards a solution that can
prevent another isolation period. It serves as a critical element in
bolstering safety measures around campus grounds, by identifying
high-density areas susceptible to potential safety hazards, like
overcrowding.</p>
<p>The main goals and aims of this project align closely with what
academic institutions aim for, such as: - promoting student well-being -
improving operational efficiency - creating an environment that fosters
learning By allowing anyone to see a the crowd density and presence
values, Crowd pulse doesn’t just make administrative work easier but
also gives students and faculty the power to make smart choices about
where they go on campus. This makes everyone feel more connected and
collaborative, adding to the project’s importance beyond just the
technical side.</p>
<p>To sum up, Crowd pulse stands out as a solution that not only tackles
the challenges faced by university campuses but also embodies the spirit
of technological innovation and collaborative effort. Its ability to
transform campus management practices and enhance the overall campus
experience firmly establishes it as a project of interest and value
within the realm of higher education. ## Background Research ### What

<h3 id="what-does-crowd-pulse-do">What does Crowd Pulse do?</h3>
<p>Crowd Pulse utilizes the pre-existing Wi-Fi network to get the crowd
density of particular areas, this is stored, so that users can see the
historical data for locations around an area such as a university
campus, to help with campus security, day to day scheduling, as well as
space and resource allocation.</p>
<p>The Crowd Pulse project aims to modernize the campus, by utilising
WI-FI crowd detection, to create a solution to monitoring crowd presence
and density on the university campus. Utilising this would be beneficial
to the university, Staff, students, and administration. ##### Wide

</ul>
<p>In this section I talk about the Laws that may or may not apply to
the project, I outline which Laws and guidelines might provide issues
with the project if any and which laws and guidelines may not apply, and
what I did about it. #### GDPR The General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) isa legislation by the EU and EEA aimed at protecting
individuals’ personal data rights, it was enacted in April of 2016. It
governs data processing, protection, ensures transparency, and
confidentiality.</p>
<p>GDPR, or the General Data Protection Regulation, is a set of laws
designed to protect the privacy and personal data of individuals. It
aims to ensure that personal data is processed transparently and fairly,
while also giving individuals more control over their own data[13].</p>
<p>GDPR grants data subjects some of the following rights: 1.
<strong>Right of Access</strong> - To know if your data is being
processed and access to it. 2. <strong>Right to Rectification</strong> -
Allows you to request the rectification of inaccurate or incomplete
data. 3. <strong>Right to Erasure</strong> - Allows you to request the
removal of your data. These rights are designed to empower individuals
to have more control over their own personal data and it’s use.
Essentially GDPR is about providing a better safeguard for people’s
personal information in today’s digital age.</p>
<p>Due the the project’s nature it could be speculated that the project
uses, personal data to achieve the monitoring of people. However I made
a conscious decision to avoid using as much personal information as
possible, the only data collected is the number of devices under a
specific wireless access point, and there is no use of personally
identifiable data.</p>
<p>However, the Crowd pulse system does collect potentially identifiable
data: - MAC addresses - used only to identify the device vendor - Device
IP address - used to identify unique devices - Device Name - used to
check if the device is of a specific model / make This data is only used
to identify vendors, to disregard networking infrastructure devices.
#### DPA The 2018 Data Protection Act or DPA serves to update and
modernize data protection laws within the UK, aligning them with the
GDPR of the EU. The act regulates the processing of personal data and
lays down rules regarding how organizations collect, handle and store
personal data[14].</p>
<p>The act applies to ‘Personal Data’ which refers to information that
relates to individuals. It empowers individuals with rights similarly to
how GDPR does so. The act establishes a regulatory framework for data
protection enforcement and designates responsibilities to the ICO
(information Commissioner’s Office) to oversee compliance.</p>
<p>As Stated Earlier Crowd Pulse only collects identifying data, for the
prepose of removing networking infrastructure devices from the crowd
density. #### ICO Guidance As mentioned earlier the ICO or Information
Commissioner’s Office can provide guidance on data protection laws and
regulations, including GDPR compliance. These laws and regulations make
sure that crowd monitoring projects involving Wi-Fi scanning techniques
comply with legal requirements, respect individuals’ privacy rights[15].
### BCS Code of Conduct BCS stands for (British Computer Society), this
section is about the BCS code of conduct and outlines the professional
standards and guidelines that members of the BCS are expected to adhere
to in their practice. It provides a framework for promoting and
maintaining high standards of competence, integrity, and professionalism
within the field of computing[16]. The code of conduct, addresses
various aspects such as: - confidentiality - respect of privacy - and

</blockquote>
<p>I believe that I have upheld the BCS code of conduct during the
development of Crowd Pulse. Once again the crowd pulse project only
utilises the following data, to specifically remove networking
infrastructure the crowd data: - <strong>MAC addresses</strong> - used
only to identify the device vendor to remove networking devices -
<strong>Device IP address</strong> - used to identify unique devices -
<strong>Number of Devices</strong> - used to create crowd density values
### Privacy Considerations / Concerns of the Project</p>
<h4 id="ethical-issues-considerations">Ethical Issues /
Considerations</h4>
<p>During the Crowd Pulse Project it was important to me that I consider
the ethical implications and concerns before implementing a system like
this. Due to the nature of the Crowd Pulse project it involved
monitoring and analysing crowd presence and density in different
locations, this could potentially raise privacy concerns among the
individuals being monitored, therefore it was important to me that I
decide on what is acceptable and what was not:
<strong>Acceptable</strong> - Aggregated and anonymized data collection
to ensure individual privacy is maintained - Utilizing technology that
focuses on crowd presence and density rather than individual
identification <strong>Un-Acceptable</strong> - Collecting and storing
personally identifiable data for the purpose of tracking individuals. -
Utilizing surveillance methods that infringe on privacy rights - Using
Live Data during the development process ##### Data Security Given the
nature of the system I wanted to ensure that the data being stored and
used did not have any meaningful way of identifying individuals,
Outlined below is the strategy I used to keep the data stored safe and
secure. 1. <strong>Data Minimization</strong>: Crowd Pulse will limit
the collection of personal data to only what is necessary for the
system’s functionality, ensuring that the least amount of identifiable
information is gathered. This aligns with privacy principles and reduces
the risk associated with unnecessary data storage. 2. <strong>Encryption
and Anonymization</strong>: Any data that is collected will be encrypted
and anonymized to prevent unauthorized access and to ensure that
individual identities cannot be discerned from the stored information.
3. <strong>Compliance with Data Protection Regulations</strong>: Crowd
Pulse will adhere to all relevant data protection regulations, ensuring
that the handling and storage of user data complies with legal
requirements to safeguard user privacy and security. ## Design and

<h3 id="how-the-project-is-managed">How the Project is managed</h3>
<p>I used a multitude of different ways to manage my project. For source
control and backups, I used GitHub [1], my oracle cloud instance [17],
and Google Drive [18]. Using GitHub allowed me to utilize GitHub issues
and projects, which allowed me to track tasks easily, an example of
which was the Kanban board below. I used my Google Drive as well as my
own server to store backups periodically to avoid backup loss if
something were to happen to GitHub. This way, I had a higher degree of
redundancy baked into the project. #### Kanban ![[Pasted image

<h4 id="requirements-analysis">Requirements Analysis</h4>
<p>In the Following Section I will go through some of the functional and
non-functional requirements, I though where important to Crowd Pulse
during development. I will cover which requirements I viewed as
mandatory, which I viewed as Desirable, and reasoning for not completing
some of them. ##### Functional Requirements ###### Device Detection 1.
The System must employ a method that relies on IoT Devices or Wi-Fi
Functionality 2. It should be capable of monitoring the crowd density in
multiple sub areas, or producing crowd density data for an entire area
###### Real-Time Data Collection &amp; Analysis - Implementing real-time
data collection and analysis to provide immediate insights into crowd
density, would be a great bonus to the project, but near real-time data
would suffice - Ideally the system should be responsive and provide
timely information ###### Integration with Existing Infrastructure -
Seamless integration with the university’s existing systems would be
extremely useful in providing easy access to the users - Compatibility
with current systems would allow for a more efficient solution ######
User Experience &amp; User Interface (UX and UI) - Designing and
developing a user-friendly interface (web app) for visualising the data
would enhance the experience of the users greatly ###### Scalability and
Historical Data - The system must be easily expandable to cover multiple
sub areas - The System should store some historical data of some kind to
draw from to do trend analysis - The system should enable users to
access historical insights ##### Non-Functional Requirements ######
Privacy and Security - The system must adhere to the privacy principles
set out by the university and the BCS, collecting and only aggregating
anonymized data ###### Usability - The user interface should have a
design that is easy to understand and navigate - Features should be
logically organized for convenience - Providing customizable views and
filter options to cater to different user preferences - Ensure that the
interface is accessible to users with diverse needs - Implementing a
feedback mechanism for users to report issues or provide suggestions
#### Planning ##### Initial Proposal and Requirements Analysis Crowd
Pulse began with the creation of a comprehensive project proposal. This
proposal outlined the project’s objectives, scope, and deliverables.
Following this, an analysis of requirements was done to identify the
specific areas for successful completion. This initial phase laid the
groundwork for the project’s planning and execution. ##### Development
of Project Plan With a clear understanding of the project’s goals, I
developed a plan. This plan detailed the tasks, timelines and
milestones, giving me a roadmap for the project’s progression, though
this was not always accurate, the initial project planning was outlined
by the Gantt chart below: ![[Pasted image 20231123123439.png]] #####
Execution and Monitoring Throughout the project, I followed the
established project plan and when I encountered Limitations and
unforeseen setbacks, changed the plan, timelines and milestones. I
decided to have regular self-assigned checkpoints, where I would
evaluate my progress and decide what was best for the project, these
checkpoints often included talks with my academic advisor, but not
always, as shown in the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Project Log
section in the appendences.</mark> This proactive approach ensured that
the project remained on track toward successful completion, equipping me
with valuable practical skills in project management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!warning] Remove Highlighting #### Kanban ![[Pasted image
20240405140730.png]] #### Project Plan During the initial Steps of the
project it was important to establish a planned methodology. As I have
worked with different methodologies before, namely agile, waterfall and
scrum [3] initially I decided I would use a waterfall method, as
described by the Gantt Chart shown previously, after the waterfall
methodology did not work as well as I had hoped due to setbacks, I chose
to implement the Agile methodology as shown by the diagram below:
![[Pasted image 20240405141209.png]] [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After moving to the agile development process, the workflow became
easier to manage, it allowed me to work on developing Crowd Pulse, and
create sub prototypes (a prototype of a specific section), which greatly
improved my efficiency.</p>
<p>The Crowd Pulse Project was guided by utilizing SMART targets /
goals, these allowed me to have a more streamlined development workflow,
in this instance SMART [2] refers to a way of setting objectives that
are: 1. Specific 2. Measurable 3. Achievable 4. Relevant 5. Time-based
Some of these SMART targets included: - Achieve 60% accuracy rate in
identifying crowd density in testing data using scanning techniques. -
Identify and prioritize 3 high traffic areas within the test data. -
discover 4 low density areas, within the testing data. - Identify and
designate 3 campus zones with consistently high crowd density levels
##### Project Phases As described above in the Gantt Chart of the
initial project plan which I developed using Team Gantt [19] a reliable
Gantt chart creation tool, the process of creating Crowd Pulse was done
in phases, these phases are shown in the Gantt Chart, as well as the
agile methodology example but to go over them again they are: -
<strong>Ideas / Research Phase</strong> - In this phase I was focused on
generating ideas, backed by research, and developing those ideas rather
than creating anything, this also held the start of the project
planning. - <strong>Design Phase</strong> - During This phase I was
focused on furthering the ideas that held the most substance, and
started to create diagrams of how these ideas would function and create
the flow of the system. this is where the bulk of the planning,
designing prototypes and diagrams happened. - <strong>Implementation /
Coding</strong> - During this Phase I started coding the prototype
ideas, and picking which systems to use, using the agile methodology
here has beneficial as it allowed me to refine my prototypes, and
allowed my designs to become better. - <strong>Testing</strong> - In
this phase I tested the system, I was guided by my academic advisor as
well as, my own targets, to avoid testing in a live environment, but
create synthetic data that would simulate way a live environment would
behave - <strong>Deployment</strong> - This was a mostly theoretical
project stage as I decided before that deployment into a live
environment would pose security and privacy concerns already mentioned.
##### Source Control - GitHub &amp; GiTea I used GitHub, as well as my
own self hosted version GiTea, on a VPS (Virtual Private Server on my
oracle instance) on my cloud instance. GiTea, is a selfhosted
alternative of GitHub, the primary goal of GiTea is to make an easy,
fast, painless self hosted git service, and as GiTea is written in Go it
works across all the platforms and architectures that are supported by
Go[20]. For this project I will only be using GiTea as an extra level of
protection or redundancy, This is so that I will always have some form
of the project available to me that is under source control, allowing me
to have a backup of the project available even if GitHub where to go
down or corrupt in some way. ###### Project / Issue Management GitHub
has a feature called projects, these are things that can be synced to a
repo to allow you to manage it’s issues and track your progress I will
be used it for this exact purpose, in The Planning Section I showed an
image of the Kanban View of this tool.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="how-crowd-pulse-works">How Crowd Pulse Works</h3>
<p>Crowd Pulse’s Scanning Technique is built around a program named
Nmap. Nmap (or Network Mapper) is a robust network auditing tool, that
is used for network exploration and security auditing. It’s functions by
leveraging IP (internet Protocol) packets to identify hosts (devices on
a network), then by analysing these packets it can provide information
on these hosts [21], below are some examples of what kind of scans can
be done: - <strong>Host Discovery</strong> - This shows basic
information about hosts on a network. - <strong>Port Scanning</strong> -
This shows information on the ports that different hosts have open. -
<strong>OS Detection</strong> - This shows information on the ports
scanned, and uses probabilities to determine what OS the host devices
are using. By discovering devices, detecting OSes and scanning ports, we
can identify which OS a device is likely to be using, which is useful in
removing network architecture from our data.</p>
<p>Crowd Pulse Relies on the following 3 Assumptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!warning] Assumption 1 - All members of a crowd
<strong>will</strong> have a discoverable device This is because if a
crowd member does not have a discoverable device, then it is impossible
to log their presence in the crowd using Crowd Pulse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!warning] Assumption 2 - All members of a crowd will have their
device connected to the local Wi-Fi This is a “safe” assumption because
the Local Wi-Fi enables the Staff and Students to utilize university
resources, such as Computer and Study Space booking, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!warning] Assumption 3 - Members of a crowd will have only 1 device
connected to the local Wi-Fi at a time This is due to the fact that
there would be simply too many devices to sort through which, would
inflate the crowd density artificially.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crowd Pulse was designed with these assumptions in place, to allow me
to develop a much simpler system than otherwise required. Without these
assumptions It would require more work, to determine an accurate crowd
density value for areas, where there are likely to be more devices per
person, for example a lecture theatre in use.</p>
<p>Crowd Pulse Works by first checking the permissions it has - If Crowd
Pulse has access to the network topology then it is able to identify the
areas with the highest crowd density values, this can then be applied to
an interface in which a user would more easily understand this data. -
If Crowd Pulse does not have the network topology then it can only
generate the crowd density for the entire area (Wi-Fi network) which
significantly limits it’s functionality. The system captures data to
pinpoint areas with high crowd density, facilitating optimal resource
allocation and space management, on the administration side. As well as
creating informed users, an example of this would be a student looking
for a place to eat on campus, they would then check the Crowd Pulse
System which provides the user with the crowd density information,
allowing them to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>With access to the network structure, Crowd Pulse can significantly
enhance its capability to identify “personal” devices with greater
precision. This means that instead of merely generating crowd density
values for the entire campus, it can pinpoint Wireless Access Points for
more localized crowd density values.</p>

<h3 id="the-development-journey">The Development Journey</h3>
<h4 id="initial-ideas-of-iot-and-wi-fi">Initial Ideas of IoT and
Wi-Fi</h4>
<p>At the onset of our project, I considered various approaches for
monitoring crowd density on a campus network. The initial ideas revolved
around two primary technologies - Internet of Things (IoT) and Wi-Fi.
IoT referred to the use of connected devices such as sensors or beacons
that could provide real-time data about device presence within their
proximity. On the other hand, Wi-Fi offered a more comprehensive
approach by either scanning the entire network for connected devices and
estimating crowd density based on their numbers, or somehow utilising
the existing network topology to “map” individual areas.</p>
<p>The rationale behind IoT was to set up a network of sensors or
beacons across the campus that could detect the presence of devices
within their range. By deploying these devices in strategic locations, I
aimed to estimate the crowd density of different areas on the campus.
However, this approach required significant investment in hardware and
infrastructure. Moreover, there were many variables to consider: related
to device placement, battery life, and ensuring network connectivity for
the IoT devices. ##### IoT Approach: The Internet of Things (IoT)
approach for Crowd Pulse would have involved deploying a network of
connected sensors throughout the target area (campus). These sensors
would be responsible for detecting and reporting the presence of devices
within their range. The benefits of this approach include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Fine-grained data collection</strong>: IoT sensors can
provide more accurate and detailed information about crowd density, as
they are placed in specific locations and cover smaller areas.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time analysis</strong>: With the IoT network, Crowd
Pulse can perform real-time analysis of crowd density data, allowing for
immediate action to be taken when necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, there are also downsides to this approach. Such as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Cost and infrastructure</strong>: Setting up an IoT
network requires significant investment in both hardware and maintenance
costs. It also necessitates the installation of a robust communication
infrastructure to enable seamless secure data transfer between sensors
and a central server.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complexity</strong>: Managing and maintaining a large
number of sensors can be challenging, especially when it comes to
updating firmware, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring their security.
##### Wi-Fi Approach: The Wi-Fi approach for Crowd Pulse would have
involved utilizing the Wi-Fi access points already present on campus to
collect data on crowd density. This method does not require additional
hardware beyond what is already installed. The benefits of this approach
include:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced cost and infrastructure</strong>: Since no
additional hardware is required, there are no significant upfront costs
or ongoing maintenance expenses for Crowd Pulse using the Wi-Fi
approach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Widely available</strong>: Wi-Fi networks are common in
educational institutions, making it an easily deployable
solution.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Despite its advantages, this approach also comes with its
downsides:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Limited accuracy and coverage</strong>: Since crowd density
data is collected based on the number of devices connected to a single
access point, there may be inaccuracies or inconsistencies when it comes
to crowd density measurements. Additionally, the Wi-Fi method may not
provide detailed information about specific areas with high crowd
density due to the larger coverage area of access points.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations for real-time analysis</strong>: Since Crowd
Pulse using this approach relies on the Wi-Fi access points for data
collection, it may not be able to perform real-time analysis as the IoT
approach due to potential network latencies or limitations in processing
power at the access points. #### Potential Hybrid IoT Wi-Fi approach
Considering the limitations of both IoT and Wi-Fi approaches, I decided
a hybrid approach might be better. This method combined the benefits of
both technologies - IoT’s ability to provide real-time data from
specific areas and Wi-Fi’s comprehensive coverage of the entire network.
Under this approach, IoT devices would have been deployed in critical
areas such as a campus library, lunch areas, cafes, shops, etc., to
monitor crowd density in those particular spaces. In contrast, Wi-Fi was
used to estimate the overall crowd density across the campus network by
scanning for connected devices.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Benefits of Hybrid Approach</strong>: 1. Improved Accuracy:
Combining data from both IoT devices and Wi-Fi access points can result
in a more precise determination of crowd density. 2. Enhanced
Flexibility: The hybrid approach would allow Crowd Pulse to adapt to
various environments, as it could utilize available Wi-Fi networks when
IoT devices are not an option. 3. Scalability: The hybrid system could
expand its reach by integrating with existing campus Wi-Fi
infrastructure and adding IoT devices where necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Downsides of Hybrid Approach</strong>: 1. Increased
Complexity: Managing and coordinating data from multiple sources, both
IoT devices and Wi-Fi access points, can add complexity to the system
design and implementation. 2. Cost: The hybrid approach would require a
larger budget due to the additional cost of purchasing and deploying IoT
devices alongside existing campus Wi-Fi infrastructure. 3. Privacy
Concerns: Utilizing both technologies could potentially increase privacy
concerns as more data is being collected from various sources. #### Move
to Only Wi-Fi approach Despite the potential success of the hybrid IoT
Wi-Fi approach, I foresaw some challenges related to the implementation,
maintenance, and cost of IoT devices. The high cost, complex
installation process, and intermittent connectivity issues made me
reconsider the strategy. I decided to shift entirely to a Wi-Fi-based
solution. <strong>Benefits</strong>: - Utilizes existing Wi-Fi
infrastructure - No need for additional hardware installation (sensors)
- Reduced costs compared to IoT approach - Less complicated setup and
implementation process <strong>Downsides</strong>: - Lack of network
topology information - Limited crowd density precision, only able to
provide overall density data - Real-time analysis may be challenging due
to data processing requirements</p>
<p>In this approach I envisioned the system utilise the existing Wi-Fi
infrastructure to map out the devices connected to the Wi-Fi, due to the
nature of a campus location, most people would be connected to the
campus Wi-Fi, and so could be crowd data can be gathered. I initially
wanted the system to scan the network, discover the topology of the
network and then utilising that topology, generate crowd density data
for each individual Wireless Access Point (WAP) on the network for each
WAP I would be able to generate the crowd density, correlate that to the
real-world location and display that information to users. ####
Unknowable Topology The Discovery that discovering / mapping topology as
a “user device” was impossible, posed a significant challenge. In
response, I reconsidered the initial IoT device approach, as well as an
approach that utilised an exported topology to remove this challenge
entirely. I noted that routers and other “management devices” had the
network topology, I learned in some cases you can export the network
topology [22]. And So I continued with the approach using an exported
topology and supplementing that data with a scanning system. #### Hybrid
Topology and Scanning Approach The Hybrid Topology and Scanning approach
combines the usage of both network topology information, if available,
and scanning techniques to generate crowd density and monitoring values.
This method offers some benefits over the initially considered options.
For instance, it provides more comprehensive data by utilizing both
sources when possible. Additionally, it offers increased flexibility
since it can function even when network topology information is not
available. Furthermore, it may allow for real-time analysis of crowd
density in specific areas, providing valuable insights to users.</p>
<p>Benefits of Hybrid Topology and Scanning approach: - Comprehensive
data collection (when topology is available) - Increased flexibility
(can function without network topology) - Real-time analysis possible
(in some cases) ### Project Extensions / Different Methods</p>
<p>In this section I’ll go over some of the different methods that were
considered for the implementation of the project. #### Computer Vision
Using computer vision is an option, that could be explored by using some
code to monitor the people who are entering and exiting buildings it
would give a good indication on how many people are inside the building.
This has the drawback of not being able to monitor people who are
outside of areas with cameras, and so would be very difficult to get an
accurate measurement for the crowd density.</p>
<p>This would also require some form of Machine Learning to identify
people within a crowd and be able to distinguish the different people it
comes across, similar to a facial recognition system which raises
security concerns. #### Subnet Sectioning Implementing subnet sectioning
for different areas of the campus within the Wi-Fi network
infrastructure could significantly enhance the efficacy of crowd
detection systems like Crowd Pulse. By allocating specific subnet
addresses to distinct zones, devices connecting to wireless access
points would automatically be assigned to their corresponding subnet
based on their location. This approach streamlines the scanning process,
enabling the system to pinpoint user devices more accurately and thereby
provide more precise readings for crowd density in each designated area.
Such precise localization of user devices within the network can greatly
improve the effectiveness of crowd monitoring and management efforts on
campus. Additionally, this method enhances crowd management, event
safety, and infrastructure monitoring, ensuring comprehensive coverage
and efficient resource allocation. This also means that Crowd Pulse
would not require network topology privileges to work effectively. ####
Mac Address Swap Tracking using ML Utilizing Machine Learning presents a
promising avenue for addressing the MAS Problem most network scanning
software encounters (Mac Address Swapping). A potentially viable
strategy entails conducting multiple scans during off-peak hours to
comprehensively map out the infrastructure. By meticulously filtering
known devices, ML algorithms could hone in on outliers, specifically MAC
address swaps, with greater precision. For instance, if a device
suddenly disappears from the network while another device with a
different MAC address emerges simultaneously, it could indicate a MAS
event. Which could help in identifying “people” #### Time Scanning
During the quieter hours of the night, we would conduct periodic network
scans to establish a foundational baseline of the networking devices
present. These scans encompass a comprehensive range of network
components, including switches, routers, and access points, etc.
Providing a detailed overview of our networking infrastructure. These
initial scans serve as a foundational reference point for subsequent
scans aimed at crowd detection. By identifying and cataloguing the
devices present during these off-peak scans, I can effectively filter
out known entities from our crowd detection algorithms, thereby
augmenting the accuracy and reliability of our monitoring systems. ##
Project Limitations In the development phase of my project, I
encountered several limitations that posed potential challenges to its
functionality and effectiveness. These obstacles ranged from technical
constraints like unpredictable network topologies to practical concerns
such as overlapping IP addresses and vendor MAC rotations. ###
Unknowable topology One notable limitation was the unpredictable
topology of the network, which complicated the accurate monitoring and
management of network classes and devices. To address this issue, I
implemented two methods, the first a dynamic discovery mechanism. This
mechanism scans the network for new devices, ensuring updates to the
database. The Second Method was allowing a user to supply the program
with the network topology, allowing for enhanced functionality. ###
Network range class Another significant obstacle I faced involved the
network range classes, which occasionally led to overlapping IP
addresses and difficulties in device identification. To mitigate this
challenge, I opted for CIDR notation. This allowed me to precisely
define the IP address range for each network class, facilitating clear
differentiation and accurate device tracking. ### Mac Address Rotation
Additionally, I grappled with the challenge posed by vendor MAC
rotations, which jeopardized device identification due to the constant
shuffling of MAC addresses. While considering potential solutions, I
meticulously weighed the costs and benefits of implementing Machine
Learning algorithms to automatically detect and adapt to MAC rotations.
After thorough deliberation, I made a conscious decision not to pursue
this particular problem. This determination stemmed from the realization
that other facets of the project held greater significance, and
diverting resources to address this issue would detract from those
priorities. Instead, I chose to bolster the existing strategy by
concentrating on consistently updating the database with known vendor
MAC addresses and their corresponding device types. This proactive
approach yielded positive results, ensuring steadfast and accurate
device identification, even amidst MAC rotations. ### Real-Time-Analysis
Another Limitation that I ran into during development was the aspect of
real-time data, initially the plan included real-time data analysis,
however due to the time required for scanning or processing the network
topology, real-time data became much harder to implement, due to this I
decided, that it would be better to focus on the other aspects of the
project and use timed intervals, much like other projects of this type,
for example the Bridgton and Hove Bus app, which uses time intervals, to
refresh the data, they use a time delay of 10s for a live map refresh,
this allows time for the processing and provides the user with a
relatively quick data refresh [23].</p>
<p>Despite facing a multitude of challenges, I effectively implemented
solutions to mitigate their impact, ensuring the seamless operation of
my network management system. Through meticulous planning, strategic
decision-making, and diligent execution, I navigated through
complexities and upheld the integrity of the network infrastructure.
This accomplishment serves as a testament to my unwavering dedication
and proficiency in overcoming obstacles and delivering optimal results.
### What does the project do vs initial plan for project Crowd Pulse is
a solution designed to monitor the presence and density of users across
a large scale area. Initially the idea was to use scanning techniques to
discover the network topology and then develop the data into usable
metrics for crowd detection and monitoring, however due to some of the
limitations that where encountered, the Project changed into what it is
now. The Crowd Pulse Project, has developed into a system that can
accept the network topology as an input, or use scanning techniques to
generate crowd density and monitoring values, this differs from the
initial desired implementation as the system is unable to get the
network topology itself, in the case the network topology is not
provided the system will only be able to generate crowd a singular crowd
density value for the entire area, and not individual areas, like the
initial design, however when crowd pulse is given the network topology,
the system is able to identify areas that are busier than others, and
show this to a user. ## Testing Due to the nature of the Crowd Pulse
project, I decided it would be best to use a blend of synthetic and
real-world data. In accordance with the laws and regulations mentioned
earlier in this report, I only used the crowd pulse system on network’s
I had direct authorization to do so.</p>
<p>Initially I tested the system a small home network, which did not
accurately simulate the environment that the the project would be
deployed in, i.e. large area networks that have high device counts. So
to fix this I decided to use a python module named Faker,</p>
<p>Faker is a Python package that generates fake data for you. Whether
you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents,
fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from
a production service [24]. I utilized faker to create synthetic data, I
created data that simulated network topologies.</p>
<p>I created a system that would allow the movement of devices between
the different locations on a topology, I did this to simulate a more
realistic environment, this showed that the crowd pulse project is
capable of monitoring the network accurately.</p>
<h5 id="how-was-it-tested">How was it tested?</h5>
<p>As stated before initially the project was tested on small home
networks, that I had access to at the time. Due to the nature of the
project, I decided that testing on small home networks was not the best
way to test the project, as it was built for crowd monitoring on a
larger scale.</p>
<p>I thought of a different way to test the project, without access to a
large scale network due to potential privacy and security issues.
Synthetic data, this would allow me to create much larger data that I
could use to test the system.</p>
<p>Using the Faker library allowed me to simulate various network
environments realistically, This synthetic data generation approach
provided a controlled yet expansive testing environment without
compromising actual user data. By generating data representative of
real-world network behaviours, I could assess the project’s performance,
scalability, and accuracy under conditions akin to its intended
deployment. This comprehensive testing approach helped identify and
rectify issues early in the development cycle, ensuring a more robust
and reliable final product.</p>

used to Test Crowd Pulse.</p>

Evaluation ### The Problem The challenge we’re facing centres around the
need for a more effective monitoring of crowd presence across university
campuses. At Present there is no system that is used to monitor the
crowd density within campus grounds. This is an oversight that became
apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, a system like the one described
in this report would help in day-to-day operations and would become
critical during significant events, such as campus fairs, open days,
protests and would be useful during another pandemic / epidemic. ### The
Solution The proposed solution is Crowd Pulse, a system that utilizes
the pre-existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to monitor the approximate
location of “user devices”, this means that when connected to the Wi-Fi
the device’s approximate location is logged, for historical data
analysis to show where the busiest areas on the campus are. Crowd Pulse
Works by using the existing Wi-Fi Access Points that are scattered
around the campus by logging the devices that are connected to these
Wi-Fi Access points we can correlate the number of devices connected to
the crowd density in that location.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
<p>The significance of this Problem and the solution was of incredible
importance only a couple of years ago, when the COVID-19 pandemic struck
the world. A system of this type would have allowed users to have a
lower chance of infection by avoiding the areas that this system would
have identified.</p>
<p>Without a solution to this we are unable to identify the busiest
locations of a campus, we are unable to locate areas where resources are
not being used, and we are unable to locate potential crowd based
security risks.</p>
<p>With a solution to this we would be able to identify all of these
things, and have the historical data to make informed decisions, such as
re-allocating unused resources such as computers, staff, etc. to more
used areas.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-the-best-solution">Why is this the best
Solution</h3>
<p>Crowd Pulse Stands as the best solution to this problem for the
following Reasons: 1. Crowd Pulse uses the pre-existing infrastructure
2. It has multiple applications - Locating busy areas and events -
Locating under used areas and resources - Locating potential security
risks 3. It can be used on a day-to-day basis 4. It it can easily be
expanded on</p>
<h3 id="does-it-work-as-intended">Does It work as Intended?</h3>
<p>The answer to this question is more complex than you might think.
Does Crowd Pulse Work as described by the Project Proposal, kind of, the
project proposal stated the following:</p>
<p>The primary objectives: 1. develop a system for detecting using Wi-Fi
or IoT 2. Real-Time Data analysis 3. Integration with existing
university infrastructure 4. User Interface</p>
<p>The Current System, fulfils the first objective as the project
utilizes the existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>The second objective I deemed to be too expensive in time and
resources, when developing, I decided that having historical data would
suffice for users, I think that it would not be hard to estimate the
real-time crowd density, based on the existing historical data.</p>
<p>The third objective is more of a grey area, when I wrote the
objective I wanted the system to be integrated into the university
mobile app, so that anyone could access the information. However I was
advised by my project supervisor that this would involve getting
permissions and going through an extensive approval process. On the
Other hand the system is integrated with the university infrastructure
in the sense that the Wi-Fi infrastructure is used.</p>
<p>The forth objective I did implement but I believe it could have been
done better, website and User interface design has never been a strong
point for me, however I decided that a simple UI would be better than no
UI at all.</p>
<p>So the Answer Remains does it function as intended? yes, it may not
have met all the original aims and objectives, but I can say that the
crowd pulse is functional and works how I currently intend it to. ####
How Well does it work? Crowd Pulse demonstrates it’s effectiveness in
addressing the identified problem by accurately monitoring crowd density
and presence. Through the data collection and analysis</p>
<p>Below is a graph showing the Crowd Density Values for the topology
below it, it is just one instance in time and does not show the
historical data but does show locations that are the busiest, as shown
by the red coloration. ![[Pasted image 20240425121117.png]] ![[Pasted
