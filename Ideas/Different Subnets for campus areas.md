using different subnets for different areas of the campus would allow a system like Crowd Pulse to more easily scan the network for user devices and therefore be able to generate more accurate readings for crowd density

Implementing subnet sectioning for different areas of the campus within the Wi-Fi network infrastructure could significantly enhance the efficacy of crowd detection systems like Crowd Pulse. By allocating specific subnet addresses to distinct zones, devices connecting to wireless access points would automatically be assigned to their corresponding subnet based on their location. This approach streamlines the scanning process, enabling the system to pinpoint user devices more accurately and thereby provide more precise readings for crowd density in each designated area. Such precise localization of user devices within the network can greatly improve the effectiveness of crowd monitoring and management efforts on campus. Additionally, this method enhances crowd management, event safety, and infrastructure monitoring, ensuring comprehensive coverage and efficient resource allocation. This also means that Crowd Pulse would not require network topology privileges to work effectively.
