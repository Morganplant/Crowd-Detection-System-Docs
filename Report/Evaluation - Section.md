### Explain the Problem:
The challenge we're facing centres on the need for more effective monitoring and analysis of crowd density and presence across university campuses. It's a multifaceted issue with far-reaching implications. At present, we're grappling with the absence of a robust system to accurately track the ebb and flow of people within campus grounds. This deficit in oversight not only impacts routine day-to-day operations but becomes particularly critical during significant events such as protests, campus fairs, or when implementing safety protocols during public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing this issue necessitates a comprehensive approach by developing and implementing a monitoring systems tailored to the unique dynamics of university settings, we can significantly enhance our ability to anticipate and respond to fluctuations in crowd density. This will serve to reduce risks and empower campus authorities to make informed decisions, thereby safeguarding the welfare of the entire university community.
### Explain the Solution:
The proposed solution named "Crowd Pulse." This is a system that utilises the pre-existing infrastructure of the Wi-Fi, as an example the Wireless Access points that are scattered around could be used, This would allow you to correlate the device numbers to density of people in that area. Through data collection and analysis, Crowd Pulse will provide insights into crowd density across various campus locations.

### Explain Why It Matters:
The significance of this Problem and the solution was of incredible importance only a couple of years ago, when the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world. A system of this type would have allowed users to have a lower chance of infection by avoiding the areas that this system would have identified. During a pandemic this system becomes indispensable, and during day to day activities, this system, would provide a way for the Staff and Security to enhance the safety and security of the Students, and Staff. It would also be able locate areas, that are not being utilized properly for redistribution. An example of this could be A computer lab being under used, i.e. only half of the computers are being used, and so the system could be used to locate these types of areas.
### Why Is This Solution Best:

Crowd Pulse Stands as the best solution to this problem, for the following reasons;
- Flexibility
- Scalability
- Capabilities
This is because the, Crowd Pulse System is able to utilise the pre-existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, this is already a large reason as to why this system is better than others, For instance, a Computer Vision based system, you would need a new camera infrastructure, as well as some form of facial recognition software for the ability to count how many unique individuals are in an area, as well as the privacy violations that such a system would cause. Crowd Pulse bypasses these restrictions, by identifying people based on how many devices are connected to individual Wireless Access points or by identifying people utilising a network scanning variation. Which allows Crowd Pulse the previously stated benefits.
### What Other Things Could Be Done Better:
While Crowd Pulse presents a comprehensive solution, there are areas for potential improvement. Enhancements in privacy measures, such as implementing advanced encryption techniques and providing clearer communication on data usage, could further bolster user trust. Moreover, refining the system's scalability to seamlessly integrate with existing campus infrastructure and expanding compatibility with different devices would enhance its adaptability.

### How Well Does It Work:
Crowd Pulse demonstrates effectiveness in addressing the identified problem by accurately monitoring crowd density and presence. Through its data collection and analysis, it provides insights, allowing authorities to take proactive measures. The user-friendly interface enhances usability, ensuring accessibility for all stakeholders. Overall, Crowd Pulse effectively fulfils its primary objective of enhancing safety and resource management within university campuses.

### Does It Work in the Desired Way:
Yes, Crowd Pulse functions as intended by effectively monitoring crowd density, providing insights, and offering a user-friendly interface for visualization. Its implementation of either Wi-Fi topology or Wi-Fi scanning ensures adaptability to different campus environments, while its capabilities enable proactive decision-making. Thus, Crowd Pulse aligns with the desired outcome of enhancing safety, security, and resource utilization within a university campus environment.
