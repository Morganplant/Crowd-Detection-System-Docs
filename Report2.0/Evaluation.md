## Evaluation
### The Problem
The challenge we're facing centres around the need for a more effective monitoring of crowd presence across university campuses. At Present there is no system that is used to monitor the crowd density within campus grounds. This is an oversight that became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, a system like the one described in this report would help in day-to-day operations and would become critical during significant events, such as campus fairs, open days, protests and would be useful during another pandemic / epidemic. 
### The Solution
The proposed solution is Crowd Pulse, a system that utilizes the pre-existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to monitor the approximate location of "user devices", this means that when connected to the Wi-Fi the device's approximate location is logged, for historical data analysis to show where the busiest areas on the campus are. Crowd Pulse Works by using the existing Wi-Fi Access Points that are scattered around the campus by logging the devices that are connected to these Wi-Fi Access points we can correlate the number of devices connected to the crowd density in that location.

### Why This Matters
The significance of this Problem and the solution was of incredible importance only a couple of years ago, when the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world. A system of this type would have allowed users to have a lower chance of infection by avoiding the areas that this system would have identified.

Without a solution to this we are unable to identify the busiest locations of a campus, we are unable to locate areas where resources are not being used, and we are unable to locate potential crowd based security risks.

With a solution to this we would be able to identify all of these things, and have the historical data to make informed decisions, such as re-allocating unused resources such as computers, staff, etc. to more used areas.


### Why is this the best Solution 

Crowd Pulse Stands as the best solution to this problem for the following Reasons:
1. Crowd Pulse uses the pre-existing infrastructure
2. It has multiple applications
	- Locating busy areas and events
	- Locating under used areas and resources
	- Locating potential security risks
3. It can be used on a day-to-day basis
4. It it can easily be expanded on

### Does It work as Intended?
The answer to this question is more complex than you might think. Does Crowd Pulse Work as described by the Project Proposal, kind of, the project proposal stated the following #insert-reference-to-appendix:

The primary objectives:
1. develop a system for detecting using Wi-Fi or IoT
2. Real-Time Data analysis
3. Integration with existing university infrastructure
4. User Interface

The Current System, fulfils the first objective as the project utilizes the existing infrastructure.

The second objective I deemed to be too expensive in time and resources, when developing, I decided that having historical data would suffice for users, I think that it would not be hard to estimate the real-time crowd density, based on the existing historical data.

The third objective is more of a grey area, when I wrote the objective I wanted the system to be integrated into the university mobile app, so that anyone could access the information. However I was advised by my project supervisor that this would involve getting permissions and going through an extensive approval process. On the Other hand the system is integrated with the university infrastructure in the sense that the Wi-Fi infrastructure is used.

The forth objective I did implement but I believe it could have been done better, website and User interface design has never been a strong point for me, however I decided that a simple UI would be better than no UI at all.

> [!warning] Make sure it Works Before adding next section

So the Answer Remains does it function as intended? yes, it may not have met all the original aims and objectives, but I can say that the crowd pulse is functional and works how I currently intend it to.
#### How Well does it work?
Crowd Pulse demonstrates it's effectiveness in addressing the identified problem by accurately monitoring crowd density and presence. Through the data collection and analysis
