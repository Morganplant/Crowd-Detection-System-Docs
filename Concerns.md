- Initially when I started the project I thought I would be able to use the network topology to designate areas, such as:
  - Computer-Lab-1 - AP
  - Arts A02 - AP
    I discovered that that's not possible for a device connected as a "user" device and not at the management level, so I'm currently making two prototypes:
  1.  Where the prototype is at the management level and knows the topology of the network and so can, query the existing infrastructure about how many devices are connected to an access point
  2.  A scanning prototype that scans the entire network and can get an estimate of the "people" on campus, but not specific areas
  3.  The third prototype does not exist yet but will be some form of IoT device that can be placed around an area to detect when "people" are nearby

now you know the context for the situation. I am unsure how to proceed, with the project, currently I am writing the final report, with the topics outlined in the "Report Topics.pptx" file.

note the second prototype (scanning variation) will take much longer to acquire data, so I am thinking of changing that one to use multi-processing / threading to shorten the time taken to scan the network

### Questions

1. What do you think is the best course of action? in regards to the above situation
2. What parts of the Final Report Topics are most important and should be given more focus time?

Any input would be amazing,
thank you in advance
