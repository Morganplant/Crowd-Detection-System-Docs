Using computer vision is an option, that could be explored by using some code to monitor the people who are entering and exiting buildings it would give a good indication on how many people are inside the building. This has the drawback of not being able to monitor people who are outside of areas with cameras, and so would be very difficult to get an accurate measurement for the crowd density.

This would also require some form of Machine Learning to identify people within a crowd and be able to distinguish the different people it comes across, similar to a facial recognition system.
