It may be possible to circumvent the MAS (Mac Address Swap) problem, by using Machine Learning, it could be done by doing several scans at night when no one is around to discover the infrastructure, then we could remove those from the equation, however the ML would be more useful, to detect when a MAS has happened and identify that a swap occurred, for example if a device using a specific address disappears at the same time a new device joins, this could potentially be a MAS
