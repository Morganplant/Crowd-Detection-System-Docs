## Introduction

This project revolves around the conceptualization, execution, and evaluation of a crowd density and presence detection system. Leveraging either Wi-Fi or IoT devices, the system aims to determine areas of high crowd density, providing users with crucial information for making informed decision making. The name of this project is "Crowd Pulse", this comes from the idea that the system will monitor the how high the crowd density is hence the first word "Crowd" and pulse because it will monitor the "Pulse" of the areas it is deployed in.

The interface in which users will interact with the system will be designed with the intent that anyone can easily use the system to make informed decisions. The interface will most likely be a web application. Web applications have become more popular in recent years as they allow the user a near seamless experience with minimal development costs depending on the type of web application chosen for design [4]. Picking the right kind of web application depends on the functionality, Later in this report I talk about the functionality and which type of web app I believe to be suitable for this project.

## Project Description

The overarching goal of this project is to fashion a modern and efficient solution for monitoring crowd density and presence in a university campuses setting. The system aspires to offer the capability to monitor and analyse crowd presence and density across various university areas, employing either Wi-Fi technology or IoT devices. The main focus lies in crafting a system that not only monitors but also enables users to visualize the data in a meaningful way. This visualization aspect is crucial for providing valuable insights into locations with high crowd density. Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance the safety and security of students and staff while optimizing resource allocation and space utilization within the university campus.

### Objectives

The Crowd Pulse Project will be guided using SMART targets / goals these will allow for a more streamlined development process, in this instance SMART refers to a way of setting objectives that are clear, trackable and achievable [8]

#### User-friendly Interface

In pursuit of the primary objective, the project aims to design and develop a user-friendly interface. This interface could take the form of either a web application or a mobile application. The objective is to create a seamless platform for visualizing near-real-time user data.

Expanding on the user-friendly interface, it's crucial to ensure that the design is intuitive and accessible to a diverse user base. Incorporating features such as customizable views, filter options, and updates. This can significantly enhance the user experience. The interface should be responsive and capable of adapting to various screen sizes, making it accessible on both computers and mobile devices.

## Motivations

My reason is for Academic Growth and Problem Solving, I often find myself looking for the next problem to solve and at the time of COVID-19 it seemed appropriate to develop some form of detection system, to help avoid infection, This would help in the case that an epidemic or pandemic where to occur again, as the system would be able to tell where the busiest areas are and notify users, this means that users could then avoid those areas, to avoid infection.

This system would also be a great advantage to avoid queues in stores / cafes / other areas, it would allow the user to locate busy areas and then be able to plan around that new data, currently there is no such system that helps with this hence why I thought it would be an interesting and challenging problem to solve.

## Ethics

During development of Crowd Pulse it is important to consider the ethical concerns and implement strategies to address these concerns such as privacy and data security. However Ethics will be talked about in much more detail later in this report.

### Privacy

Due to the nature of the Crowd Pulse project it involves monitoring and analysing crowd presence and density in different locations, this could potentially raise privacy concerns among the individuals being monitored.

### Data Security

Given the nature of a system that collects and analyses user data, ensuring the security and integrity of the data is of utmost importance, as such Crowd Pulse will endeavour to use the minimal amount of user data possible to ensure there is no useful way for Crowd Pulse to be used to track individuals. In addition to holding as little identifiable data as possible, the data which is required will be thoroughly protected.

## Professional Considerations

Throughout the development and execution of the Crowd Pulse project, it is essential to uphold professional standards, best practices and ensuring the quality and reliability of the implemented system. I will go over the BCS code of conduct and how that ties in with the Crowd Pulse project, what issues arose and how they where dealt with

## Project Scope

The scope of the Crowd Pulse project encompasses the design, development, and deployment of a crowd density, presence detection system within a university campus settings.

Moreover, the project scope extends to considerations of scalability and adaptability, ensuring that the system can be tailored to different university areas and potentially extended to other public spaces. The project will also delve into the integration of security and privacy measures, ethical and legal compliance, and the potential for future enhancements and expansions of the system. Clear delineation of the project scope is fundamental to aligning expectations, resources, and deliverables throughout the development and implementation phases.

### Assumptions

> [!error]- Each user will have a smartphone / similar device

> [!warning]- The user's Device will be discoverable
