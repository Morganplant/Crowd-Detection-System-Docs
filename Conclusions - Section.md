### What Design Choices where made along the way

1. Initial Ideas of IoT or Wi-Fi
2. Move to a Hybrid IoT Wi-Fi approach
3. Move again to Only Wi-Fi approach
4. Discovering that mapping Topology was not possible
5. Moving to Hybrid Topology given and Scanning approach

### Why was it difficult 

- The limitations where difficult to navigate
	1. Unknowable topology
	2. Network range class (for scanning)
	3. Mac Address Rotation
	4. Real-time Analysis

### What was the cleverest part?

### What did you discover / learn

- Unknowable topology
- Rediscovering the different network range classes and why they are useful
